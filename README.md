# Ruby Exercises and Terminology 
[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - one level of API out of multiple layers of API by which you can use to manipulate software or hardware <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - a form in which data is stored and which dictates in what way and what methods you can manipulate that data <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - a "container" which holds data.  Also conversely a placeholder that points back to specific stored data. <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - local variable is within a method scope and can only be accessed within that method scope.  constant variable is immutable.  global variable exists outside of a method scope and can be accessed both inside and outside of a method <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - inside or outside of methods <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - once defined, can not be changed <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - block of code/instruction that can be called and therefore reused <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive ruby <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - symbols that perform calculations on data <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - a blueprint for creating an instance of an object <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - a package manager that provides a standard format for distributing ruby programs and libraries. <br>

## Part 2
## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - Allows for code to be run when a particular condition is true <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - If introduces the code to be ran if condition is true.  Elseif introduces alternative code to be run if it is true (and previous if statement is false).  Else runs code when it's true (and previous if statement and elsif statements are false) <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - Case introduces a variable.  When introduces a comparison to the variable and if true, then specific code is run. <br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em> - either an array or a hash?  I'm not sure exactly <rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - a data structure that holds elements organized by indexes <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - specific methods that you can access on specific data types <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - iterates through a data structure (arrays, hashes, ranges) <br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - a loop that will never have a condition allowing it to end/break <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - see line 25 <br>


## Part 3
<em>**What is Object Oriented Programming?**</em> - manipulating information by storing information in objects and then manipulating methods and variables in those objects <br>
<em>**Class inheritance**</em> - transferring class methods and variables from a parent class to a child class. <br>
<em>**What are getters and setters?**</em> - make class attributes accessible outside of the class method and allow you to access them and assign values to them. <br>
<em>**Difference between class variables and instance variables and class attributes?**</em> - class variable-  <br>
<em>**What does self signify in a class?**</em> - INSERT ANSWER HERE <br>
<em>**Modules</em> - INSERT DEFINITION HERE <br>
